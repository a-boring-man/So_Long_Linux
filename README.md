# So_Long_Linux

The goal of this early 42 project was to create a minimalist 2D game using sprites and a map system. It was the first graphical project at 42 that was made to run with the 42 minimalist graphics library, 42minilibx, on macOS.

This was my first time using structs, and it was also my first project requiring some level of file and code organization to respect the 42 norm. Overall, it was a fun experience.

For some reason, this Linux port severely limits the game's performance and graphics.

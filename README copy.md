A early 42 Project

the goal was to create a minimalist 2D game using texture and a map system.

the first graphical project of 42 made to run with the 42 minimalist graphic library 42minilibx on Mac.

first time I used struct, this was also my first project requiering some level of file and code organisation to respect the norm imposed by 42, overall a fun experience.
